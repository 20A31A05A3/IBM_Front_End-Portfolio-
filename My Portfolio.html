                <p >
                    Hi, I am <b>Chodavarapu Pavan Raj</b> -a Computer Science Student. I am currently pursuing BTECH in Pragati
            Engineering College.
            I am a hard-working passionate person who believes in the importance of education and accessibility
            to technological advancements.</br>
            <br>I've always been passionate about learning new things, whether reading a book ,watching a movie or
            listening to music.I
            am a qiuck learner and active listener. I am good at communication. As a computer science student you need
            to explore new things, new
            technologies and try to adapt to the changes.</br>
            <br>I am good at Java Programming and HTML,CSS. I've done a Communtity Service project as a part of my
            academics.
            In this project me and my team members designed a web portal "Awareness on CYBER CRIMES AND CYBER FRAUDS".
            I've done few internships
            like TCS MBU SIRIUS 2023, AWS AI-ML,cloud architecture etc. It was an amazing experience
            and I can confidently say that i've learnt so many new things. In TCS MBU internship me and my team members
            designed
            a web portal "DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS AND FRAUDS" and created a chatbot.</br>
            <br>I wanted to become a successful expert in the ﬁeld of Information Technology by channelizing my
            technical knowledge
            and skills to ensure personal and professional growth
                </p>

            <p>I previously worked on a Community Service Project. The Community Socio-economic survey was conducted
                in order to
                find about the rate of occurance of cyber frauds and crimes among the people. The survey resulted in the
                identification
                of different types of Cyber-crimes and the impact of it on their personal information.</br>
                <br>Different cyber crimes and frauds were identified and appropriate precautions were discussed during the
                survey.
                In this way, the people were able to understand how to deal with such attacks and how to handle such
                problems in their
                day to day lives.In addition to that, we identified the situation of the cyber-crimes in the communities and
                the overview
                of the problems faced by the people.</br>
                <br>This survey helped us to find out the cyber issues and we tried our level best to provide better
                solutions to their problems.</br>
                <br>Based on our concept of "AWARENESS ON CYBERCRIMES", we have designed a webpage for uploading our
                research content which
                would be helpful and create awareness on various cybercrimes.</br>
                <br> The core technologies we have used to design our webpage are HTML and CSS. HTML helps us to display the
                contents of the
                webpage whereas CSS help us to style our webpage.</br>
